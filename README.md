# Destiny-2-Discord-Rich-Presence

## This now works!
I haven't packaged this yet, but will soon.

If you clone this repo, run `npm start` after installing modules with `npm i`
Search your Destiny playername and if Discord is open, your presence should be populated.

# TODO
I'm planning on cleaning up the file structure, adding some well-needed comments, spiffying up the code, and adding a history to playersearch.
Also need to package the application.


I've only tested this on OSX so far, so feel free to attempt with Windows/Linux and open an issue.
Also feel free to ask about feature requests.
