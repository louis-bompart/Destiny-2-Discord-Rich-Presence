## This now works!
I haven't packaged this yet, but will soon.

# Compatibility
I've only tested this on OSX so far, so feel free to attempt with Windows/Linux and open an issue.

Also feel free to ask about feature requests.

## Running
If you clone this repo, run `npm start` after installing modules with `npm i`

Search your Destiny playername and if Discord is open, your presence should be populated.

## TODO
- Cleaning up the file structure
- Adding some well-needed comments
- Spiffying up the code
- Adding a history to playersearch
- Package the application
- Fix zip-stream errors
