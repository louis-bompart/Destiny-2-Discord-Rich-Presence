# This now works!
Downloads are under [releases](https://github.com/BrightSchema/Destiny-2-Discord-Rich-Presence/releases/)

## Compatibility
This has only been tested on OSX and Windows. If you want a Linux release, please open an issue or message me.

## Running
First you need to create an API key at https://www.bungie.net/en/Application I'm hoping to remove this requirement in the future, but for now it works.  
Next, run the installer and run the program. Enter your API key when prompted.  
Finally, search your Destiny playername and if Discord is open, your presence should be populated.  
The first time run, the presence may not update immediately. This is due to the time required to download the manifest to lookup activity definitions. If it doesn't update within 30 reload the page with `cmd+r` or `ctrl+r` 

### TODO
- Spiffying up the code
- Adding a history to playersearch
- Affinitization
